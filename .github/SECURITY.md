# Reporting a Vulnerability

You can report a vulnerability by creating an issue on this repo. If you want to report it privately, you can email me at [tlovinator@gmail.com](mailto:tlovinator@gmail.com).

There is also [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/TheLovinator1/discord-reminder-bot/security/advisories/new) if you want to be try-hard.

I am also available on Discord at `TheLovinator#9276`.

Thanks :-)
